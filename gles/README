Building on a OpenGL ES target
------------------------------
(Assuming a Ubunt/Debian-like Linux System)

* Install your GPU drivers

* Packages:
  # apt-get install build-essential libsdl-dev libopenal-dev
  
* Build:
  > cd gles
  > make

* Configuration Options:

[config]
# use a small system
amiga_model = A500
fullscreen = 0

# in GLES its important to set the right texture format
video_format = rgb565
texture_format = rgb

# use low accuracy for faster speed 
accuracy = -1

# might improve performance
video_sync = off
