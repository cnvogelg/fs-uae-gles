FS-UAE LAUNCHERS

If you are using the source distribution, you should be able to install
FS-UAE Launcher by running "python setup.py install". The setup procedure
requires python setuptools to be installed.
(sudo apt-get install python-setuptools)

You start FS-UAE Launcher by running "fs-uae-launcher". This requires
wxPython and pygame to be installed.
(sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8 python-pygame)

SCREENSHOTS

Screenshot paths are currently derived from the name of the configuration file.
If the configuration file is named Test.fs-uae, the two displayed screenshots 
will be found in:

(My) Documents/FS-UAE/Titles/T/Test.png 
or ~/Games/Amiga/Titles/T/Test.png 

and (the right one):

(My) Documents/FS-UAE/Screenshots/T/Test.png
or ~/Games/Amiga/Screenshots/T/Test.png


TODO

- Show error message when FS-UAE is not found.

- Support loading just e.g joystick_port_0_mode = joystick config value
  (without joystick_port_0) and set joystick_port_0 to a sensible value
  automatically (last used joystick in that port, if available).

- Handle some more corner cases, sanitize configurations a bit better on
  loading.

- Finish the net play support with integrated lobby, chat and game setup.

- Perhaps bundle a freely distributable and fun single-player game with some
  fs-uae / launcher distributions (must work with the AROS kickstart).

- Perhaps bundle a freely distributable and fun multi-player game with some
  fs-uae / launcher distributions (must work with the AROS kickstart) when the
  net play functionality is integrated into the launcher.
