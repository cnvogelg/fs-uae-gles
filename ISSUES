* The PearPC fallback may not work properly. Please make sure you are using
  the qemu-uae plugin (check in fs-uae.log.txt that it is loaded properly)
  if you're having problems.
* AmigaOS 4.1 w/Picasso IV => sometimes weird frame rate (~36 FPS).
* When starting FS-UAE from FS-UAE Launcher, accelerator flashs ROM writes
  are not persistent because the launcher uses a new copy every time.
* Booting CD32 with CD inserted works, but inserting later, or eject +
  re-insert does not seem to work right now.
* Booting A1000 to kickstart screen does not work. Broke in FS-UAE 2.5.9dev /
  WinUAE 2.9.0 beta 9.
